# IADSP
A collection of little DSP classes and functions

Nothing too fancy here, just a few things I reuse from time to time and want to be separate from other libraries.

However some of the classes do require [JUCE](https://github.com/juce-framework/JUCE). For now it's just the __FiFo__ and the __ParameterListener__, which are both utilities for working with some of JUCE's features, so you'd only need them if you're already using JUCE.
